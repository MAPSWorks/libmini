The "Fraenkische Schweiz" Demo is provided under the terms of the GPL
Copyright (c) 2002-2007 by Stefan Roettger

To compile under Linux, MacOS X, Irix or Windows follow these steps:

 1) make sure that OpenGL and the GLUT library are installed
 2) download latest "MINI-x.x.zip" and "Fraenkische.zip" from this location:
    http://stereofx.org/download
 3) unpack both zip archives to the same directory
 4) if pthreads are not installed undefine PTHREADS in Fraenkische.cpp
    however it is highly recommended to have posix threads installed
    on Windows use the implementation from http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32
 5) compile the demo using the "build.sh" script in the "Fraenkische" directory
    (for Windows use cygwin or the supplied VC++ project files)
 6) type "Fraenkische" on the console or double click at "Fraenkische.exe"
 7) ESC quits the demo
 8) in order to enter manual mode start the demo with -D [-t]
 9) then try the following keys: w a d s < > j 0 l p o e (q quits the demo)

Optionally, the demo can be run with server support (i.e. streaming
over the internet). For this to work, the libcurl library must be
installed. Get it from http://curl.haxx.se. Then define LIBCURL in the
Fraenkische.cpp and recompile. Now the demo tries to stream all the
terrain data from the stereofx.org server. The parameter REMOTEURL
defines the location of the data, so it is possible to unpack the demo
on any http server on a private LAN or WLAN, for example, and tell the
demo to stream from this place.

The demo includes data from the Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF,
http://glcf.umiacs.umd.edu). It also includes tree billboard textures
from vterrain.org (Thanks Ben!).

Have fun,
Stefan
