 2) download the latest "MINI-x.y.zip" and "Hawaii.zip" from this
    location: http://stereofx.org/download
 3) unpack both zip archives to the same directory
 4) compile the library using the "build.sh" script in the "mini" directory
 5) compile the demo using the "build.sh" script in the "Hawaii" directory
    (for Windows use cygwin or generate VC++ project files with CMake)
 6) type "Hawaii" on the console or double click at "Hawaii.exe"
 7) then try the following keys: w a d s < > j b m 0 l p o c (q quits the demo)

The USGS 1:250,000 DEM quads have been converted via the dem2pgm tool.
The USGS 1:24,000 SDTS DEM quads have been converted via the sdts2dem tool.

These tools are part of the demo and can be compiled with the command:
 "build.sh tools"

Have fun,
