For building libMini only OpenGL is required to be installed. See the libMini README for instructions.
For building the libMini viewer on *nix it is assumed that pthreads libjpeg libpng and libcurl are already installed.
Then the libMini viewer also requires the dependencies glut/freeglut squish and optionally GREYCstoration.
These dependencies can be built from the respective source code packages in the deps folder.
For Windows prebuilt static libaries are available in the WIN32 folder.
