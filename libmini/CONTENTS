For building libMini, only OpenGL needs to be installed. See the libMini README for instructions.
For building the libMini viewer on *nix, it is assumed that pthreads libjpeg libpng and libcurl are installed.
Then the libMini viewer additionally requires the dependencies GLUT/freeGLUT squish and GREYCstoration (optional).
These dependencies can be built from the respective source code package in the deps folder.
For Windows, prebuilt static libaries are available in the WIN32 folder.

The libMini dependencies are available here:
