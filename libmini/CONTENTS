For building libMini only OpenGL is required to be installed. See the libMini README for instructions.
For building the libMini viewer on *nix it is assumed that pthreads libjpeg libpng and libcurl are already installed.
Then the libMini viewer requires the additional dependencies freeglut squish and optionally GREYCstoration.
The latter dependencies can be built from the source code in the deps folder.
For Windows prebuilt static libaries are available in the WIN32 folder.
