The libMini package also contains the libMini Viewer (see
Section <a href="#MiniViewer">(P)</a>). This application is a generic
viewing utility for terrain data and tile sets. For example, it can be
used to display the demo data mentioned above, load tilesets generated
with the <a href="http://libgrid.googlecode.com">libGrid</a> library
or stream terrain data over the internet that has been produced with
the Virtual Terrain Builder
from <a href="http://www.vterrain.org">vterrain.org</a>.<p>

<a href="#" class="top">Back to top</a>

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2>(A) Introduction</h2>

The Mini Library applies a view-dependent mesh simplification scheme
to render large-scale terrain data at real-time. For this purpose, a
quadtree representation of a height field is built. This quadtree is
also utilized for fast view frustum culling and geomorphing.<p>

Within this distribution the files needed to build the basic terrain
rendering library are included. In order to keep the library portable
any system dependent stuff like window management is not part of this
distribution. Nevertheless, the Mini Library implements all the
necessary graphics algorithms to setup a high-performance terrain
rendering system.<p>

The main goal for developing the library was to keep it as compact,
stable and efficient as possible and not to blow it up by adding
unnecessary features. Thus, Mini stands for "Mini Is Not Immense!" in
a rather positive sense.<p>

<a href="#" class="top">Back to top</a>

<a name="Compilation"></a>
<h2>(B) Compilation</h2>

It is assumed that the libMini zip package has been downloaded and
uncompressed to a "mini" folder. On a Unix system, the preferred
download option is to check out the entire libMini source repository
with subversion:

<pre>
   svn co http://libmini.googlecode.com/svn/libmini libmini
</pre>

The build.sh shell script compiles the library on Irix, Linux and
MacOS X. Simply type "./build.sh" in your Unix shell (requires the
tcsh to be installed). <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a> is
required as the single dependency of the library. To install the
library and the necessary include files in /usr/local on your Unix
machine type "./build.sh install" as a super-user.<p>

Optionally, you can
use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf">autoconf</a>
or <a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> to build libMini. For the
former, type "./configure && make" and for the latter type "cmake . &&
make" in a Unix shell.<p>

The library also compiles on Windows by using CMake. For Windows it is
recommended to check out the whole libMini package with Tortoise SVN
from "libmini.googlecode.com/svn/libmini".<p>

To compile, simply specify the "mini" directory as the source and
binary directory in the CMake GUI and click the generator button. Then
open the generated VC++ project and compile with Visual Studio. You
can also run the build on the MSVC Command prompt via the "build.bat"
batch file.<p>

Alternatively, you can use cygwin in the following way:<p>

<ul>
   <li>Run the <a href="http://cygwin.com">cygwin</a> setup program</li>
   <li>Make sure to install "Devel" and "Shells" from the packages list</li>
   <li>Double-click the cygwin icon to get a bash session</li>
   <li>In bash, type: "cd mini" and "./build.sh"</li>
</ul>

As another option, you can use MinGW in the following way:<p>

<ul>
   <li>Run the <a href="http://mingw.org">MinGW</a> installer "mingw-get-inst.exe"</li>
   <li>Make sure to install "g++" and "MSYS" from the packages list</li>
   <li>Add "C:\MinGW\bin;" to your PATH environment variable</li>
   <li>The environment variables are located in Settings->System->Advanced</li>
   <li>Install CMake from the <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">exe installer</a></li>
   <li>Start the MinGW shell to get a bash session</li>
   <li>In bash, type: "cd mini" and 'cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" .'</li>
   <li>Then compile as usual with "make"</li>
</ul>

Other than the specified operating systems are not officially
supported, but there is a good chance that libMini will build via
automake or CMake.<p>

As described in the following section, the distribution contains a
libMini application example. The example can be compiled by typing
"./build.sh example" in a shell. It requires GLUT to be installed. On
Windows it is recommended to use
the <a href="http://freeglut.sourceforge.net">freeGLUT library</a> as
a replacement for the standard GLUT library. For convenience, the
libMini distribution already contains the freeGLUT headers and the
prebuilt static freeGLUT library.<p>

<a href="#" class="top">Back to top</a>

<a name="TerrainRenderingAPI"></a>
<h2>(C) Terrain Rendering API</h2>

In this section the low level API of the Mini Library (the libMini
core) is described. Convenient high level methods for a variety of
commonly encountered terrain rendering scenarios are described in
Sections <a href="#Frontends">(F)</a>, <a href="#LibraryStub">(G)</a>,
<a href="#Performance">(I)</a>, <a href="#AsyncPaging">(K)</a>
and <a href="#ViewerAPI">(O)</a>. The recommended starting point for
experienced graphics programmers is the <a href="#ViewerAPI">libMini
Viewer API</a> and its reference implementation, the libMini tile set
viewer, which is described in
Section <a href="#MiniViewer">(P)</a>. Please check out whether or not
the high level scenarios suffice your needs before you dive into the
low level API:<p>

The main include file is "mini.h" which contains the definition of the
low level terrain rendering API (the libMini core). In order to port
it to a different graphics architecture, only the file "miniOGL.cpp"
needs to be adapted. It encapsulates all OpenGL calls that are made
inside of the libMini core.<p>

In the following the low level terrain rendering API is explained by
drawing a small example height field. This task is broken down into
eight basic steps. The full example code is included in the
distribution (see "example.cpp").<p>

<h3>Step 0) Include the libMini core header:</h3>

<pre>
   #include &lt;mini/mini.h&gt;
</pre>

<div class="note">
   <b>Note:</b> On Linux the libMini headers are usually placed in the
                "/usr/local/include/mini" directory after installation
                (via build.sh; build.sh install). So the libMini
                headers should be included with the "mini/" prefix,
                since "/usr/local/include" is already in the default
                search path. On Windows the libMini installation path
                can be added with the VisualStudio-> Tools-> Options->
                Projects-> Directories menu entry.
</div><p>

<h3>[Optional] Step 1) Specify the fine tuning parameters:</h3>

   The fine tuning parameters are initialized to suitable values, so
   normally this step can be omitted. However, for more flexibility
   the parameters can be set explicitly via
   mini::setparams(minres,maxd2,sead2,minoff,maxcull). In the terrain
   rendering paper minres is referenced to as C, maxd2 is the maximum
   value for the linear mapping of the d2-values, sead2 determines the
   influence of the extracted sea surface onto the d2-values, and
   maxcull defines the number of quadtree levels for which the view
   frustum culling is performed.<p>

<h3>Step 2) Open a window:</h3>

   For that purpose the glut library is used in the example.<p>

<h3>Step 3) Height field initialization:</h3>

<pre>
   // a small example height field
   short int hfield[]={0,0,0,
                       0,5,0,
                       0,0,0};

   int size=3; // grid size of the square height field
               // (can be any number>2, but preferably 2^n+1, n>0)

   float dim=10.0f; // cell dimension = horizontal grid point spacing
   float scale=1.0f; // vertical scaling of the elevations

   void *map,*d2map; // spare void pointers

   map=mini::initmap(hfield,&d2map,&size,&dim,scale);
</pre>

<h3>Step 4) Texture map initialization:</h3>

<pre>
   // a small example RGB texture map
   unsigned char texture[]={255,63,63, 255,63,63, 255,63,63, 255,63,63,
                            255,63,63, 63,63,255, 63,63,255, 255,63,63,
                            255,63,63, 63,63,255, 63,63,255, 255,63,63,
                            255,63,63, 255,63,63, 255,63,63, 255,63,63};

   int width=4,height=4; // width and height of the texture map
                         // (can be any number>1, but preferably 2^n, n>0)

   int texid; // id of the texture map

   int mipmaps=1; // enable mip-mapping

   texid=mini::inittexmap(texture,&width,&height,mipmaps);
</pre>

<h3>[Optional] Step 5) Ground fog map initialization:</h3>

   Optionally, a ground fog layer is rendered by stacking prisms onto
   each triangle that is generated by the terrain rendering
   algorithm. The height of the fog layer is defined by the ground fog
   map. With the assumption of an uniform fog density and the
   application of an emissive optical model the volumetric projections
   of the prisms can be composed efficiently (see ground fog paper for
   more details).<p>

<pre>
   // a small example ground fog map
   unsigned char ffield[]={2,3,2,
                           3,1,3,
                           2,3,2};

   int fogsize=3; // size of the ground fog map
                  // (can be any number>1, but same size as height field preferred)

   void *fogmap; // spare void pointer

   float lambda=1.0f; // vertical dimension of the ground fog layer
   float displace=5.0E-3f; // vertical displacement of the ground fog layer
   float emission=0.05f; // optical emission of ground fog per unit length
   float attenuation=1.0f; // triangulation importance of ground fog
   float fogR=1.0f,fogG=1.0f,fogB=1.0f; // fog color

   fogmap=mini::initfogmap(ffield,fogsize,lambda,displace,emission,
                           attenuation,fogR,fogG,fogB);
</pre>

<div class="note">
   <b>Remarks:</b> For the ground fog to be rendered correctly an
                   alpha channel is required in the frame buffer.
                   Calling mini::inittexmap() with no parameters
                   results in the omission of the terrain which is
                   useful for the display of additional fog layers. An
                   optical emission of zero triggers maximum intensity
                   projection (MIP). Compared to an emissive optical
                   model MIP is much faster and does not require an
                   alpha channel.
</div><p>

<h3>Step 6) For each frame:</h3>

<h3>Step 6.1) Clear window.</h3>

<h3>Step 6.2) Setup model-view and projection matrix according to viewing coordinates.</h3>

<h3>[Optional] Step 6.3) Set actual tile:</h3>

   This step can be omitted if only a single height field is used.<p>

<pre>
   mini::setmaps(map,d2map,size,dim,scale,texid,width,height[,mipmaps,cellaspect]);
</pre>

   The optional mipmaps parameter determines whether or not mipmaps
   are enabled. The optional cellaspect parameter can be used to
   define a non-uniform spacing of the grid, that is the spacing along
   the x-axis is dim units while the spacing along the z-axis is
   dim*cellaspect units.<p>

   If a ground fog map is used the following parameters need to be passed:<p>

<pre>
   mini::setmaps(map,d2map,size,dim,scale,
                 texid,width,height,mipmaps,
                 cellaspect,0.0f,0.0f,0.0f,NULL,NULL,
                 fogmap,lambda,displace,
                 emission);
</pre>

<h3>Step 6.4) Render the terrain:</h3>

<pre>
   float res=1000.0f; // global resolution of the triangulation (in the range [1..infty])
   float ex=0.0f,ey=10.0f,ez=30.0f; // eye point
   float fx=0.0f,fy=10.0f,fz=30.0f; // focus of interest (should be equal to eye point)
   float dx=0.0f,dy=-0.25f,dz=-1.0f; // view direction
   float ux=0.0f,uy=1.0f,uz=0.0f; // up vector
   float fovy=60.0f; // vertical field of view
   float aspect=1.0f; // window width/window height
   float nearp=1.0f; // distance of near clipping plane
   float farp=100.0f; // distance of far clipping plane

   mini::drawlandscape(res,
                       ex,ey,ez,
                       fx,fy,fz,
                       dx,dy,dz,
                       ux,uy,uz,
                       fovy,aspect,
                       nearp,farp);
</pre>

   For typical height fields the parameter <i>res</i> should be set to 100-10000
   depending on the desired density of the generated mesh.<p>

<div class="note">
   <b>Hint:</b> A zero field of view disables the view frustum
                culling, whereas a negative field of view triggers the
                orthographic projection mode. In the latter case, use
                glOrtho(fovy/2*aspect,-fovy/2*aspect,fovy/2,-fovy/2,near,far)
                instead of the usual gluPerspective call to set up the
                projection matrix.<br>
</div><p>

<div class="note">
   <b>Side Note:</b> <br> You can also use the orthographic mode to
                          perform a view-independent mesh
                          decimation. Then the resolution parameter
                          determines the mesh accuracy.
</div><p>

<h3>Step 6.5) Swap buffers:</h3>

   Now we are basically done. For comparison, a screen shot of the
   result is included in the distribution (example.png).<p>

<h3>[Optional] Step 6.6) Query functions:</h3>

   Between each rendered frame the elevation and the normal at
   position (x,z) of the height field can be queried via:<p>

<pre>
   float height=mini::getheight(i,j); // (i,j) = integer grid position
   float height=mini::getheight(x,z); // (x,z) = floating point world coordinates
   float nx,ny,nz; mini::getnormal(x,z,&nx,&ny,&nz);
</pre>

   Similarly, the height of the ground fog layer (if present) can be
   queried via:<p>

<pre>
   float fogheight=mini::getfogheight(x,z);
</pre>

<h3>Step 7) After the last frame, delete all used maps:</h3>

<pre>
   mini::deletemaps();
</pre>

<h3>Step 8) Finally, close the window.</h3>

<h2>(D) Additional Comments</h2>

The size of the small height field in the above example surely is too
small for realistic terrain rendering. For convenience, a real data
set of Kluane National Park in Yukon Territory, Canada, is included in
the Yukon Demo. See also Section <a href="#RealTerrain">(H)</a> about
loading real data.<p>

The accuracy of the rendered terrain can be controlled by setting the
res parameter from the minimum value of 1 to larger values of say
1,000-100,000 depending on the actual performance of the graphics
hardware.<p>

Normally, the focus of interest, that is the point with the highest
resolution, should be equal to the eye point in order to minimize the
screen space error of the dynamic triangulation. In some cases,
however, it might be advantageous to set the focus to a different
location.<p>

Instead of choosing the default short signed integer representation
(16 bit) of the height field, a floating point representation can be
chosen by using the Mini namespace (capital first letter). This is
equivalent to calling the constructor of the ministub class with a
float height field as the first parameter.<p>

Since the algorithm uses uniform grids of size 2^n+1 in both
dimensions, a height field with this size should be supplied whenever
possible. Other sizes are scaled up internally to the next possible
size. A data set with unequal grid dimensions must be resampled
uniformly or broken up into uniform tiles prior to passing it to the
Mini Library.<p>

<a href="#" class="top">Back to top</a>

<a name="TiledTerrain"></a>
<h2>(E) Tiled Terrain (Tile Sets)</h2>

In the case that a terrain data set does not consist of a single
height field but rather of several tiled patches, each of the tiles is
setup separately:<p>

<pre>
   for (int i=0; i&lt;tiles; i++)
      {
      map[i]=mini::initmap(hfield[i],&d2map[i],&size[i],&dim[i],scale);
      texid[i]=mini::inittexmap(texture[i],&width[i],&height[i]);
      }
</pre>

Now, for each frame, the terrain is rendered in two passes:<p>

<pre>
   for (phase=1; phase<=2; phase++)
      for (int i=0; i&lt;tiles; i++)
         {
         mini::setmaps(map[i],d2map[i],size[i],dim[i],scale,
                       texid[i],width[i],height[i],mipmaps,
                       cellaspect,ox[i],oy[i],oz[i],
                       d2map2[i],size2[i]);

         mini::drawlandscape(res,
                             ex,ey,ez,fx,fy,fz,dx,dy,dz,ux,uy,uz,
                             fovy,aspect,nearp,farp,
                             NULL,NULL,phase);
         }
</pre>

Here, the additional parameters ox[i], oy[i], and oz[i] specify the
origin (center) of each tile. The remaining additional parameters
d2map2[i][0..3] and size2[i][0..3] denote the d2maps of the four
adjacent tiles and the grid size of the neighbours, respectively. The
neighbours must be specified for each tile to ensure crack-free
rendering of the entire scene. Viewed from above, the indices 0..3
correspond to the following locations of the adjacent tiles: left,
right, bottom, and top. If a neighbour does not exist, the NULL
pointer may be passed instead. In order to ensure a conforming mesh,
the elevations of shared grid points of adjacent tiles must be
identical, meaning that the shared edges need to be duplicated. After
the last frame, the allocated memory is released by subsequently
passing each tile map[i] to the function mini::setmaps() and by
calling mini::deletemaps() afterwards.<p>

As an example, the center tile of a height field can be surrounded by
tiles with a lower resolution. These low resolution tiles can be used
to represent the horizon of a scenery without consuming a large amount
of extra memory.<p>

Preferably, each terrain data set should be broken up into tiles that
fit into the L2-cache of the processor. For example a tile of size
129x129 easily fits into the L2-cache of most modern processors. In
this setup each tile consumes only 48 kilobytes of memory which leads
to a significantly improved cache coherency and performance.<p>

<a href="#" class="top">Back to top</a>

<a name="Frontends"></a>
<h2>(F) Minitile And Miniload Frontend</h2>

As mentioned above, a tiled terrain can be used to save memory and
gain speed. In such a case the minitile class provides a starting
point how to render a tiled terrain with the Mini Library. In the
constructor of the minitile class an array of file names is passed
which define the PGM height image of each tile and its corresponding
PPM texture (in column first order). The tiles must have the same
geometric extent but need not have equal resolution which means that
grid size or cell dimension may differ.<p>

Besides rendering a tiled terrain, the minitile class is also a
convenient way to just display a single height field plus a texture
without going into the details of the low level API as described in
Section <a href="#TerrainRenderingAPI">(C)</a>. For an example use
case of the minitile class please check out the Yukon Demo or the
Stuttgart Demo.<p>

If the landscape that should be visualized is extremely large and
detailed the terrain may not fit entirely into main memory. This
situation is dealt with the miniload class. It offers almost the same
functionality as the minitile class but dynamically pages visible and
invisible tiles in and out. There are two paging modes: The first one
just loads all visible tiles and displays all data up to the far
clipping plane. For this to work efficiently, the distance to the far
plane should be chosen to be considerably smaller than the actual
extent of the entire scene. The second paging mode loads the
appropriate LOD for each tile if a resolution pyramid is present. This
reduces the memory foot print drastically but may also increase the
latency during a movement of the viewer, since all the visible LODs
need to be updated dynamically. The second mode allows much larger
viewing distances as the first mode. Depending on the tile size this
comes at the expense of some latency whenever a different LOD needs to
be loaded from disk. To hide the latency the so-called preloading can
be enabled so that the requested LODs are already available before
they actually need to be rendered.<p>

By default, the tiles are stored in the PNM (PGM/PPM) format of the
netpbm library which is available
at <a
href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net">netpbm.sourceforge.net</a>. The
netpbm library, however, is not required for linking, since libMini
has built-in support for the PNM format (see
Section <a href="#PNMdoc">Appendix (A)</a>).<p>

The LODs are identified by adding the number of the corresponding LOD
to the base file name which has LOD 0 by definition. As an example,
let the tile with file name "tile.x-y.pgm" be the base LOD at column x
and row y of the grid. Then the next corresponding LOD with level 1 is
named "tile.x-y.pgm1" and so forth. If the base LOD (or LOD0) has size
2^n+1 the LODs with level l=1..n-1 (or LOD1, LOD2, ...) have size
2^(n-l)+1. Let the texture with file name "tile.x-y.ppm" be the base
texture at column x and row y of the grid. Then the next corresponding
texture LOD with level 1 is named "tile.x-y.ppm1" and so forth. If the
base texture has size 2^m the texture LODs with level l=1..m-1 have
size 2^(m-l). For different tiles the base LOD may have different tile
or texture size. While one or more levels from the top of each LOD
pyramid may be missing the base LOD has to be present in any case.
Both the height fields and the texture maps use a corner centric (not
cell centric) data representation.<p>

A basic grid resampler which is able to produce the required pyramids
is available via the pnmsample::resample(...,int pyramid) call. The
pyramid parameter controls the number of generated LODs in addition to
the base level. If the described file conventions are met the output
of any GIS program can be used, too. In fact, the latter should be the
preferred way of resampling, since the built-in resampler has several
limitations and is intended to be only a minimal "reference"
implementation. Among its limitations is the restriction to Lat/Lon
coordinates as world coordinate system and the missing out-of-core
support. The addition of these features would have blown up libMini
significantly, so if one of these features is needed in a particular
situation the tiles should be resampled with a more advanced GIS
application such as libGrid or VTBuilder from vterrain.org. The output
of VTBuilder is compatible with libMini so you are free to import the
data into your own libMini project or visualize it directly with the
VTEnviro application which also builds on top of libMini. However, if
the restrictions of the built-in resampler are not crucial, you can
call the resampler with a list of georeferenced PNM files, which will
be resampled within the range of the first file on the list (for
information about georeferencing see
Section <a href="RealTerrain">(H)</a>.<p>

To load a tiled terrain consisting of c columns and r rows one needs
to construct two string pointer arrays hf and tx containing the file
names of the PGM height fields and the ppm textures of each tile
(column first order, north-west corner first, missing tiles indicated
by null pointers). Let cd be the width of each column and rd be the
height of each row and let s be the vertical scaling of the elevations
and let (cx,cy,cz) be the offset of the center of the entire terrain
(all constants measured in meters). Then the following call does the
job with the terrain lying in the (x,-z) plane and the elevations
corresponding to the y-coordinates:<p>

<pre>
   miniload *terrain=new miniload(hf,tx,c,r,cd,rd,s,cx,cy,cz);
</pre>

In order to load tiles that have been generated with the built-in
resampler, we simply pass the number of columns and rows and the
directory where the tiles have been stored to the miniload:load
method. Then the missing parameters are determined automatically by
looking at the georeferencing information of the specified tiles.<p>

To render the scene use the following call:<p>

<pre>
   terrain->draw(res, // resolution
                 ex,ey,ez, // eye point
                 dx,dy,dz, // view direction
                 ux,uy,uz, // up vector
                 fovy,aspect, // field of view and aspect
                 nearp,farp, // near and far plane
                 update); // optional incremental update
</pre>

The library will now load all visible tiles and page in and out the
appropriate LODs automatically.<p>

By default, the tiles are rendered directly using the built-in OpenGL
graphics engine. Alternatively, a render cache (e.g. the minicache
described in Section <a href="#Performance">(I)</a>) can be attached
to the miniload class. Then the tiles are displayed indirectly by
rendering the contents of the cache. However, we do not attach the
cache to the miniload object but rather to the minitile object
encapsulated in it (use terrain->getminitile() to get it).<p>

The update parameter determines the number of frames for which the
cache persists and how long it takes to completely fill the cache. A
value of 1 causes the cache to be filled within a single frame and can
be used to flush the cache.<p>

Non-standard graphics effects can be implemented by using the hook
mechanism or the shader plugins of the minicache backend (see
Section <a href="#ShaderPlugins">(J)</a>).<p>

During run-time, the terrain can be rescaled in the range from 0% to
100% of the original elevation by calling miniload::setrelscale.<p>

Also, the sea surface can be rendered at real-time. In order to
interactively extract a specific sea level (e.g. 0) we use
miniload::setsealevel(level).<p>

For implementation reasons, this is only supported if a render cache
is attached. The contour line of the sea surface is extracted
precisely so that it matches the shore line and therefore does not
intrude into the terrain. This approach efficiently eliminates
Z-buffer fighting artifacts.<p>

By default, texture compression is enabled which means that the
textures will be compressed on-the-fly in the OpenGL driver. Since
this is a very time consuming task it can be turned off via
miniOGL::configure_compression(0). Texture mip-mapping is also enabled
by default, but it can be switched off via
minitile::configure_mipmaps(0). This further improves the texture
loading performance.<p>

The paging mechanism can be controlled via the following call:<p>

<pre>
   terrain->setloader(void (*request)(...),void *data,
                      void (*preload)(...),
                      void (*deliver)(...),
                      int paging,
                      float pfarp,
                      float prange,int pbasesize,
                      int plazyness,int pupdate,
                      int expire);
</pre>

Normally, the first four arguments should be set to NULL. Then each
tile is loaded if it is within the viewing range (that is the distance
to the far clipping plane farp). In order to ensure that invisible
tiles are already available before they actually become visible
preloading can be enabled by passing a function pointer as third
argument. The referenced function is called subsequently to notify all
tiles which need to be preloaded. However, if preloading is disabled,
visible tiles are just requested on the fly. This is recommended if
the data is available on a fast medium (e.g. a hard disk).<p>

Each requested tile is loaded either automatically by the library or
manually via the callback mechanism. The callback passes height
fields, texture maps and optional fog maps by encapsulating them into
a databuf object. The object format is flexible and can be used for
byte, short int, float and even pre-compressed texture data with an
optional alpha channel (as opposed to the PNM format which only
supports plain RGB images and only 8- or 16-bit height fields). The
databuf class has methods to load and store data in its native DB file
format (see Section <a href="#DBdoc">Appendix (C)</a>). The extension
for the native format is ".db". The databuf class also has convenience
functions for reading PNM images and PVM volumes which are the
standard format for the minibrick module (see
Section <a href="#Minibrick">Appendix (4)</a>). Pre-compressed texture
maps are preferred over uncompressed textures, because loading
is <b>much</b> faster. This is due to the fact that neither the
texture data has to be compressed nor a mipmap pyramid has to be
generated on-the-fly. Currently, only S3TC/DXT1 texture
pre-compression is supported.<p>

<div class="note">
   <b>Remark</b>: A workaround to get pre-compressed PPM images is to
                  use the databuf::loadPPMcompressed method instead of
                  the databuf::loadPNMdata method. For the first time
                  the PPM images are accessed, the uncompressed data
                  is loaded as usual. But the texture data will also
                  be compressed and written to a DB file. If the data
                  is accessed a second time it will be already
                  pre-compressed and loading will be much
                  faster. Optimally, this procedure should be applied
                  to all resampled tiles before the renderer is
                  launched.
</div><p>

For slow media or internet access preloading should be enabled so that
each call of the preload callback can be used to spawn a thread which
silently receives and stores the incoming data until it is collected
by the deliver callback. While requested data should be returned
instantly the delivery of preloaded data can be delayed until an
arbitrary point in the future. The Mini Library has a reference
implementation of an asynchronous file cache. With this cache the
rendering task can be decoupled from the loading task which leads to a
much smoother visual experience for large paged data sets. In such an
ambitious use case, please also read
Sections <a href="#AsyncPaging">(K)</a>
and <a href="#RemotePaging">(L)</a>.<p>

If a resolution pyramid is present, the library also tries to page in
the appropriate LOD l from the pyramid. If preloading is enabled, the
library requests level l as usual but also tries to silently preload
level l+1 so that the next level is delivered before it actually
becomes visible.<p>

The other arguments of miniload::setloader have the following meaning:<p>

<ul>
   <li>
   <b>paging:</b> enables/disables paging from the LOD pyramid
   <ul>
      <li>a value of zero means that only LOD 0 is used</li>
      <li>for a value of one the next larger level is paged in
          after a LOD difference of one level is reached</li>
      <li>for a value of s>=1 the next larger level is preloaded
          after a LOD difference of s-1 levels is reached</li>
      <li>recommended: 1</li>
   </ul>
   </li>

   <li>
   <b>pfarp:</b> defines the radius of the preloading area
   <ul>

<h2>(G) Library Stub</h2>

In some cases the built-in texture mapping setup or the explicit
dependency on OpenGL may be too restrictive. In order to gain more
flexibility, the internal management of the OpenGL state including the
automatic generation of texture coordinates can be disabled by calling
mini::inittexmap() with no parameters. Then all generated vertices are
passed to a callback function allowing the entire graphics state to be
handled externally. This feature also allows compatibility with
graphics standards such as DirectX or rendering engines like
Irrlicht. Using the callback mechanism from within the minitile and
miniload frontends is also possible and works analogue to the case
described in the following.<p>

If the internal OpenGL state management of the Mini Library is not
needed, one can access the library through the ministub class as shown
in the code example given below. It demonstrates the external handling
of the graphics state using explicit calls to OpenGL. If a different
graphics library should handle the graphics state we can use "build.sh
stub" to compile a library that does not contain any references to
OpenGL specific functions (use the switch -DNOOGL on Windows).
Otherwise the library must be linked against "-lGL -lGLU -lm" to
resolve the OpenGL dependencies.<p>

Since the Mini Library optionally supports ground fog rendering, the
fog mesh which consists of vertically aligned prisms have to be passed
to the calling framework as well. Three subsequent calls of the
"prismedge" callback define one fog prism by describing the ground
position (x,y,z) and the vertical size (yf) of the three vertical
prism edges. The edges are already transformed into the world
coordinate system.<p>

A test version above code can be compiled by first stripping the Mini
Library off its OpenGL dependent calls (type "build.sh stub"). Then
the stub test is compiled with the command "build.sh stubtest".<p>

For comparison, the text output of the stub test is:<p>

<h2>(H) Real Terrain Maps And Textures</h2>

A good starting point for real world terrain data is<p>

   The Global Land Cover Facility<br>
   <a href="http://glcf.umiacs.umd.edu">glcf.umiacs.umd.edu</a><p>

Free sky dome textures can be downloaded at<p>

   Philo's Sky Collection<br>
   <a href="http://www.philohome.com/skycollec/skycollec.htm">www.philohome.com/skycollec/skycollec.htm</a><p>

In order to load a real height field or texture use the PNM reader via<p>

<pre>
   #include &lt;mini/pnmbase.h&gt;

   unsigned char *data;
   int width,height,components;

   data=readPNMfile(pnmfilename,&width,&height,&components);
</pre>

If components==1 the function returns an unsigned char height field<br>
else if components==2 16 bit signed values are returned in MSB format<br>
else if components==3 an RGB color image is returned.
else if components==4 an RGBA color image is returned.<p>

If the PNM image contains an 8- or 16-bit height field we first copy
it to a short array. Then we can pass this array to the libMini core
or the ministub class for example:<p>

<pre>
   if (width!=height) ERRORMSG(); // height field must be quadratic

   short int *hfield=new short int[width*height];

   if (components==1) // 8-bit
      for (int j=0; j&lt;height; j++)
         for (int i=0; i&lt;width; i++)
            hfield[i+j*width]=data[i+(height-1-j)*width];
   else if (components==2) // 16-bit
      for (int j=0; j&lt;height; j++)
         for (int i=0; i&lt;width; i++)
            hfield[i+j*width]=(short int)(256*data[2*(i+(height-1-j)*width)]+data[2*(i+(height-1-j)*width)+1]);
   else ERRORMSG();

   free(data);

   ministub stub=new ministub(hfield,...);

   delete[] hfield;
</pre>

Alternatively, we can pass the array via the getelevation callback
which prevents the array from being copied twice:<p>

<pre>
   short int mygetelevation(int i,int j,int S)
      {
      if (components==1) return(data[i+(S-1-j)*S]);
      else if (components==2) return((short int)(256*data[2*(i+(S-1-j)*S)]+data[2*(i+(S-1-j)*S)+1]));
      return(0);
      }

   ministub stub=new ministub(NULL,...,mygetelevation,...);

   free(data);
</pre>

The same callback mechanism is implemented in the libMini core.<p>

In order to georeference a PNM image, we have to put its geographic
location into the comment of the PNM header. This is achieved by
specifying the four corners of the image in either the geographic
world coordinate system (also known as Lat/Lon) or in Universal
Transverse Mercator coordinates (UTM). The built-in resampler of the
library exclusively uses this extended PNM format (for more details
see <a href="#PNMdoc">Appendix (A)</a>). An example of a georeferenced
header is shown below:<p>

<pre>
   P6
   # BOX
   # description=PPM example
   # coordinate system=LL
   # coordinate zone=0
   # coordinate datum=0
   # SW corner=198721.93993200/-75123.60940800 arc-seconds
   # NW corner=198722.01794400/-75081.99117600 arc-seconds
   # NE corner=198766.29376800/-75082.06288800 arc-seconds
   # SE corner=198766.21917600/-75123.68115600 arc-seconds
   # cell size=.086482/.086482 arc-seconds
   # vertical scaling=0 meters
   # missing value=-9999
   512 512
   255
</pre>

The identifier "P6" stands for an RGB image and the numbers at the end
of the header define the width, the height and the maximum pixel value
of the image. For 8-bit data the maximum value is 255, for signed
16-bit data it is 32767 (or 65535). The identifier "P5" stands for
height fields (and gray scale images). The raw data of an image is
appended after the header. 16-bit data is stored in MSB format.<p>

<h2>(I) High Performance Rendering Using The Minicache Backend</h2>

The minicache backend improves the rendering performance of the
libMini core by exploiting the frame to frame coherency of a scene.<p>

Principally, the Mini Library generates a new triangle mesh for each
frame. This is necessary to suppress the popping effect by applying
the geomorphing technique. As a consequence, the dynamically generated
mesh prohibits the use of high performance rendering primitives such
as vertex arrays or vertex buffer objects, because there is virtually
no frame to frame coherency of the vertex data.<p>

However, we do not need to perform the geomorphing operation for each
and every frame. Usually 5-10 morphing operations per second appear to
be visually smooth to a human observer. If the terrain is rendered
with 50 frames per second then we can cache the generated vertices for
at least 5 consecutive frames.<p>

This dramatically reduces the CPU load, since the triangle mesh can be
updated over consecutive frames. For this to work, a tiled terrain
needs to be used, so that the mesh update can be triggered tile after
tile. The GPU load is also reduced dramatically, since the cache can
be rendered in an optimized fashion. The minicache uses vertex arrays
for this purpose.<p>

To enable the minicache we simply pass the minitile object to be
cached to the minicache:<p>

<pre>
   minitile *tileset=new minitile(hfields,textures,cols,rows,...);
   minicache *cache=new minicache;
   cache->attach(tileset);
</pre>

Then, for each frame, we trigger a partial scene update with:<p>

<pre>
   int update=5; // number of frames per update
   tileset->draw(...,update); // nothing is rendered yet
   cache->rendercache(); // render the cached vertex buffer
</pre>

This is illustrated in the Hawaii Demo and in the libMini Viewer (see
Section <a href="#MiniViewer">(P)</a>).<p>

The raw performance on a Linux box with an AMD Athlon 2.2 GHz CPU and
an NVIDIA GeForce FX 5800 graphics accelerator is about 20 million
geomorphed vertices per second.<p>

<a name="ShaderPlugins"></a>
<h2>(J) Using The libMini Shader Plugins</h2>

The standard behaviour of the minicache which basically only drapes
textures on the height fields can be extended easily by supplying
vertex and pixel shaders. If no application-specific shaders are
given, the built-in shaders just implement the standard behaviour and
can be used as a basis to write own advanced shaders as described in
the following.<p>

The default vertex shader multiplies the incoming vertices with the
combined modelview and projection matrix and computes the appropriate
2D texture coordinates for each tile. It is selected via
minicache::setshader() and enabled via minicache::useshader(). Own
vertex shaders are selected by passing a program string via
minicache::setshader("!!ARBvp...").<p>

</pre>

The parameter t holds bias and scaling constants to compute the 2D
texture coordinates in the x- and y-component of the result texture
coordinate vector. The parameter e holds the scaling factor of the
incoming elevations to compute the current true elevation. These true
elevation values are passed to the pixel shader in the z-component of
the texture coordinate vector so that per-fragment computations can
easily depend on elevation. The parameters u,v and d are used for eye
linear texture coordinate generation with texture unit #2. The
parameter vectors t, e and d are supplied automatically by the
minicache, but the parameter vectors u/v and c0-c7 may hold
user-definable constants that can be supplied via
minicache::setvtxshadertexgen(tileset,s1..t4) and
minicache::setvtxshaderparams(x,y,z,w[,n]), respectively.<p>

The default pixel shader takes the actual 2D texture coordinates and
fetches the corresponding color from texture #0 which holds the
current texture tile. After that the texture color is shaded and
multiplied with the current fragment color to mimic the standard
modulating texture environment.<p>

As with vertex shaders, the parameter vectors c0-c7 may hold four
additional user-specific constants that can be set via
minicache::setpixshaderparams(x,y,z,w[,n]).<p>

Here is a simple usage example which adds contour lines to the
bathymetry of a data set, which means that only negative elevations
will show contours:<p>

<pre>
   // declare the cache

   cache.render(...);

   // disable programs
   cache.usevtxshader(0);
   cache.usepixshader(0);
</pre>

The example is part of the Hawaii Demo (see
Section <a href="#Performance">(I)</a>), so you can actually watch the
shaders working together by pressing 'c' during the demo.<p>

<div class="note">
   <b>Hint:</b> If for any reason you need the rendered triangle mesh
                to be semi-transparent, set its opacity with
                cache.setopacity(alpha). The blended mesh, however,
                might show artifacts due to incorrect blending
                order. To avoid these artifacts we can use a two-pass
                algorithm. First, we render the mesh with alpha=0 to
                update the Z-buffer only. Then we render the mesh a
                second time with alpha>0 to blend the mesh without
                ordering artifacts.
</div><p>

Another usage example is per-fragment lighting: Let us first assume
that the RGB texture contains the horizontal components x and z of the
normal vector mapped to the R and G channels. Let us also assume that
the B channel contains a gray scale image. Then the vertical component
y of the normal vector can be computed from the horizontal components
using y=sqrt(1-x*x-z*z). For diffuse shading we supply a light
direction in the shader parameters and compute the dot product of the
light direction with the normal vector. Then we multiply this with the
B channel to get a shaded gray value. The elevations provided in the
z-component of the texture coordinate vector may be additionally used
to derive a color mapping which modulates the shaded gray values
giving a final shaded color. The advantage of using a pixel shader for
the calculation of the lighting equations is that the light conditions
can be changed interactively.<p>

<div class="note">
   <b>Hint:</b> Normal maps can be computed with
                pnmsample::normalize. The method takes a collection of
                grids and computes a georeferenced normal map for each
                of them. Afterwards the normal maps can be resampled
                just like texture maps. Both the resampled normal maps
                and the resampled texture maps are loaded by the
                databuf::loadPPMnormalized method which produces a
                texture with the normal map in the R and G and the
                gray value of the original texture in the B
                channel. Start the Hawaii Demo with the -n option to
                see the result of this approach.

<a name="AsyncPaging"></a>
<h2>(K) Asynchronous Paging</h2>

Many high-resolution terrain data sets do not fit into main memory. In
such a case out-of-core methods are needed which operate on tile
sets. This has been described in detail in the previous sections. To
give an example, we've got a data set of entire Oahu, Hawai'i, which
has a resolution of less than 0.5 meters for the texture maps. The
total uncompressed size of the data set is more than 70 GB. This
clearly doesn't fit neither into main memory nor into the texture
memory of the graphics card.<p>

In order to view this data set in real-time we resampled it to a
100x80 tile set. This tile set is visualized out-of-core using the
described libMini paging callback concept. Whenever a tile needs to be
paged into memory, the callback is triggered and the corresponding
tile is loaded. However, while loading the requested data most of the
time is wasted with busy waiting for the hard disk to seek and spin to
the correct file position. This can take up 150ms even for the tiniest
files. Since we cannot continue rendering while we wait for the data
to arrive the frame rate usually drops down to a mere 5-10 fps.<p>

Therefore, we need to decouple the disk access from rendering in order
to get a smooth rendering experience. For this purpose, the Mini
Library contains an asynchronous tile cache which loads the requested
tiles in a background thread without blocking the main rendering
thread.<p>

We first assume that the tile set is defined via a miniload
object. The tile set should contain S3TC compressed textures for best
paging performance or uncompressed textures for best image quality:<p>

<pre>
   miniload *tileset=new miniload;
</pre>

Then we enable the asynchronous paging mechanism (with a single
background thread):<p>

<pre>
   #include &lt;mini/datacloud.h&gt;

   static const int numthreads=1;

   datacloud *cloud=new datacloud(tileset);
   cloud->setloader(request_callback,NULL,check_callback,1,1.25f*farp,0.01f*farp,pbasesize,1,10,1000);
   cloud->getterrain()->setradius(0.03f*farp,1.0f); // optional non-linear texture LOD drop-off distance
   cloud->setinquiry(inquiry_callback,NULL); // optional callback for better paging performance
   cloud->setquery(query_callback,NULL); // optional callback for better paging performance
   cloud->setschedule(0.02,0.5,1.0); // upload for 20ms, keep for 30sec, invalidate after 1sec
   cloud->setmaxsize(128.0); // allow 128 MB tile cache size
   cloud->setthread(startthread,NULL,jointhread,lock_cs,unlock_cs,lock_io,unlock_io);
   cloud->setmulti(numthreads);
   threadinit();
</pre>

We additionally need to define two mandatory and two optional
callbacks (one for loading data, one for checking file existence, one
for optionally checking the elevation range of a height field and one
for optionally querying the image size of a texture map):<p>

<pre>
   void request_callback(const unsigned char *mapfile,databuf *map,int istexture,int background,void *data)
      {map->loaddata((char *)mapfile);}

   int check_callback(const unsigned char *mapfile,int istexture,void *data)
      {return(checkfile((const char *)mapfile));}

   void inquiry_callback(int col,int row,const unsigned char *mapfile,int hlod,void *data,float *minvalue,float *maxvalue)
      {
      *minvalue=0.0f;
      *maxvalue=10000.0f;
      return(1);
      }

   void query_callback(int col,int row,const unsigned char *texfile,int tlod,void *data,int *tsizex,int *tsizey)
      {
      int tbasesize=2048; // size of texture LOD 0
      while (tlod-->0) tbasesize/=2;
      *tsizex=*tsizey=tbasesize;
      }
</pre>

We finally have to define the callbacks for creating and locking the
background thread. In the following example implementation we are
using POSIX threads (pthreads), but any other multi-threading library
like OpenThreads could be used as well:<p>

<pre>
   #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

   #include &lt;mini/datacloud.h&gt;

   pthread_t pthread[numthreads];
   pthread_mutex_t mutex,iomutex;
   pthread_attr_t attr;

   void threadinit()
      {
      pthread_mutex_init(&mutex,NULL);
      pthread_mutex_init(&iomutex,NULL);

      pthread_attr_init(&attr);
      pthread_attr_setdetachstate(&attr,PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE);
      }

   void threadexit()
      {
      pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex);
      pthread_mutex_destroy(&iomutex);

      pthread_attr_destroy(&attr);
      }

   void startthread(void *(*thread)(void *background),backarrayelem *background,void *data)
      {pthread_create(&pthread[background->background-1],&attr,thread,background);}

   void jointhread(backarrayelem *background,void *data)
      {
      void *status;
      pthread_join(pthread[background->background-1],&status);
      }

   void lock_cs(void *data)
      {pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);}

   void unlock_cs(void *data)
      {pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);}

   void lock_io(void *data)
      {pthread_mutex_lock(&iomutex);}

   void unlock_io(void *data)
      {pthread_mutex_unlock(&iomutex);}
</pre>

The loaddata, loadPNMdata and loadPVMdata methods of a databuf object
are reentrant. In principle these methods can be used safely to load
data in the background thread. However, they rely on the file IO
functions of the operating system (fopen, fread, fwrite, fclose,
fscanf and fprintf of the stdlibc++) to be thread-safe as well. This
is usually the case but it is not guaranteed for all operating
systems. As a safety measurement, libMini uses the lock_io and
unlock_io functions to lock the request callback which is performing
the IO in the background thread. If it is known in advance that the
entire request callback is thread-safe, the two functions may be
omitted in the setthread call.<p>

Similarly, the loadPPMcompressed method is not reentrant because it is
using OpenGL to compress the incoming data on-the-fly. If you want to
pass S3TC compressed textures in the background thread you need to
store pre-compressed data on the hard disk and load this data with a
standard loaddata call. This approach saves a lot of disk space and is
much faster than compressing the data on-the-fly.<p>

In order to start multiple background threads we simply set numthreads
to a higher value (e.g. 10). Typically, this is not needed if data is
stored on a fast hard disk, but it has a performance advantage if the
data is arriving over a slow network connection.<p>

Adding these lines to the code will lead to a very smooth out-of-core
visualization experience even for the mentioned 70 GB data set of
Oahu. To give some performance details, the demo is running at a
consistent 25 fps on my Apple Powerbook Pro with 1.5 GB of main
memory, 1.83GHz Core Duo and ATI X1600 with 128MB VRAM.<p>

An application that is using the asynchronous tile cache should update
the scene each time the view point is changed. Additionally, it should
update the scene until there are no pending tiles left to be paged
in. This can be achieved in the following way:<p>

<pre>
   static int pending=1;
   if (pending!=0) tileset->draw(...);
   pending=cloud->getpending();
</pre>

If a render cache is attached to the tile set the cache should be
flushed after all pending tiles have been processed.

As an alternative, the application could just render continuously with
a given target frame rate. This obviously ensures that all arriving
tiles will be displayed eventually.<p>

Information about the actual streaming status can be printed by the
following example code snippet:<p>

<pre>
   printf("streaming: pending=%d mem=%gMB\n",
          cloud->getpending(), // total number of pending tiles
          cloud->getmem()); // total memory foot print
</pre>

In order to quit an application which is using the asynchronous tile
cache the background thread needs to be stopped beforehand. It is
stopped implicitly if the datacloud object is deleted but it can be
stopped at any time with an explicit call of cloud->stopthread().
Before the application can quit it also needs to release the
background thread (see threadexit() in the above example).<p>

<div class="note">
   <b>Note:</b> By default, the tile cache module releases all the
                databuf objects that are passed to it. If this is not
                the desired behaviour, the memory chunks encapsulated
                into a databuf object can be configured not to be
                released via cloud->configure_dontfree(1).
</div><p>

The performance of loading tiles from disk is mainly limited by the
number of tiles and only to a certain degree by the tile size. This is
different if the tiles arrive over a network connection (see also
Section <a href="#RemotePaging">(L)</a>). In such a case the startup
time is determined by the size and the number of the tiles that need
to be loaded initially. We can reduce the number of initially loaded
tiles (and minimize startup time) by telling libMini that only a
subset of the visible tiles is mandatory for startup. After these
tiles have been loaded initially the remaining tiles are paged in
consecutively in the background thread. Typically, a useful startup
subset is a small area around the initial point of view (ex,ey,ez):<p>

<pre>
   tileset->restrictroi(ex,ez,farp/3);
</pre>

The tile size quadratically depends on the distance to the point of
view. Therefore, the selection of a view point high above the scene
(bird's eye view) additionally leads to a reduced initial traffic on
the net. If the initial point of view is lying on the terrain, the
traffic will be much higher, but we can mimic a high point of view by
applying the following trick before the first frame is rendered:<p>

<pre>
   tileset->updateroi(res,
                      ex,ey+10*farp,ez,
                      ex,ez,farp);
</pre>

This has the effect, that only low resolution tiles are loaded
initially. These are replaced by higher resolution tiles as soon as
they are coming in over the net. To apply the trick to the entire tile
set use tileset->updateall().<p>

For very large tile sets it is also important to save disk space. With
S3TC compression only a compression of 1:6 is possible. In order to go
beyond this compression ratio, the tiles need to be stored in JPEG
format, for example. This is not a native format of libMini so that
the conversion hook of the databuf object must be registered with a
function that is able to to export and reimport that data (see
Appendix <a href="#DBdoc">(C)</a>).<p>

Since the textures are now stored in JPEG format on disk, they need to
be decoded and uploaded in raw format to the graphics memory. If S3TC
compression is required to fit the textures into the graphics memory,
we also need to recompress the textures on-the-fly. For this purpose
the <a href="http://libsquish.googlecode.com">squish library</a> of
Simon Brown is highly recommended. See
Section <a href="#AutoCompression">(M)</a> how to use this library.

<a href="#" class="top">Back to top</a>

<a name="RemotePaging"></a>
<h2>(L) Remote Paging</h2>

Those who have been reading until this point, can be truly called
libMini experts. In the following we are approaching the next level:
in the previous section we have seen how to use a background thread to
page data concurrently to rendering. To do so we need to implement the
callback API of the datacloud class. In our previous example our
implementation was just loading files from disk, but in principle it
doesn't make a difference if the data is coming from a local disk or
from a remote server. The only difference is that data will be
arriving much slower over a network connection, meaning that we should
use highly compressed data whenever possible. And of course the
implementation needs to use a library
like <a href="http://curl.haxx.se">libcurl</a> to transfer the files
from the remote server to the client.<p>

The libMini library contains a sample implementation of a transfer
module. To use this module we make the following modifications to the
example code of the previous section:<p>

<pre>
   tilecache=new datacache(tileset);
   tilecache->setremoteid(REMOTEID);
   tilecache->setremoteurl(REMOTEURL);
   tilecache->setlocalpath(LOCALPATH);
   tilecache->setstartupfile(STARTUPFILE);
   tilecache->setloader(request_callback,NULL);
   tilecache->getcloud()->setschedule(0.02,5.0,1.0); // upload for 20ms, keep for 5min, invalidate after 1sec
   tilecache->getcloud()->setmaxsize(256.0); // allow 256 MB tile cache size
   tilecache->getcloud()->setthread(startthread,NULL,jointhread,lock_cs,unlock_cs);
   tilecache->configure_netthreads(numthreads);
   tilecache->setreceiver(receive_callback,NULL,check_callback);
   tilecache->load();
</pre>

<ul>
   <li>REMOTEID is the local path or the remote id on the server.</li>
   <li>REMOTEURL is the URL of the server. If the http:// prefix is
   missing files are assumed to be stored locally.</li>
   <li>LOCALPATH is the storage path for local data on the
   client.</li>
   <li>STARTUPFILE is the name of a startup file which persistently
   stores information about whether or not a file is existing and has
   already been transferred and stored locally. This file is created
   after the client has been started up the first time. The first
   startup might take some time but after that the next client
   startups will be much faster. The startup file should be copied
   into the base directory on the server, because each client will
   first try to download it from that location on the server prior to
   generating it from scratch. For this purpose, the built-in
   resampler can be configured to write the startup file via
   pnmsample::configure_startupfile(1). The default startup file name
   is startup.sav. The install path of the resampled tile set must be
   identical to the path where the tile set is uploaded on the
   server. This means that the local path argument of
   pnmsample::configure_tilesetpath must be identical to the remote
   path argument of datacache::setremoteid.</li>
   <li>numthreads is the number of threads for concurrent net
   transfers. A useful value is 10. In contrast to a single thread,
   this improves the typical download rate from below 30kb/s to almost
   the theoretical bandwidth of 128kb/s of a standard 1000kbit ASL/DSL
   line.</li>
</ul>

The callbacks used by the transfer module are slightly different:<p>

<pre>
   void request_callback(const char *file,int istexture,databuf *buf,void *data)
      {buf->loaddata(file);}

   void receive_callback(const char *src_url,const char *src_id,const char *src_file,const char *dst_file,int background,void *data)
      {geturl(src_url,src_id,src_file,dst_file,background);}

   int check_callback(const char *src_url,const char *src_id,const char *src_file,void *data)
      {return(checkurl(src_url,src_id,src_file));}
</pre>

The geturl and checkurl functions use libcurl to negotiate and
transfer data over the net. Please see the libMini Viewer (Section <a
href="#MiniViewer">(P)</a>) how this can be done in detail.<p>

<a href="#" class="top">Back to top</a>

<a name="AutoCompression"></a>
<h2>(M) Automatic S3TC Compression</h2>

For high-resolution imagery, texture compression is crucial. For that
reason, the resampled tiles are typically stored in S3TC format (see
also previous sections). The compression ratio of S3TC is 1:6 for RGB
images. In order to achieve a higher compression ratio, JPEG can be
used as an external format.<p>

With that approach a compression ratio of up to 1:20 can be achieved
with still good image quality. However, the images now have to be
recompressed with S3TC on-the-fly. For that purpose, libMini features
the auto-compression hook. Whenever libMini encounters an uncompressed
texture and the auto-compression hook is set it automatically tries to
run the texture data through the compression hook. Below is a
reference implementation of the S3TC compression hook using
the <a href="http://libsquish.googlecode.com">squish library</a> of
Simon Brown.<p>

<pre>
   void autocompress(int isrgbadata,unsigned char *rawdata,unsigned int bytes,
                     unsigned char **s3tcdata,unsigned int *s3tcbytes,int width,int height,
                     void *data)
      {
      int i;

      int mode;

      unsigned char *rgbadata;

      static const int modefast=squish::kDxt1 | squish::kColourRangeFit; // fast but produces artifacts
      static const int modegood=squish::kDxt1 | squish::kColourClusterFit; // almost no artifacts though much slower
      static const int modeslow=squish::kDxt1 | squish::kColourIterativeClusterFit; // no artifacts but really sluggish

      mode=modefast; // we strive to compress as fast as possible

      if (isrgbadata==0)
         {
         rgbadata=(unsigned char *)malloc(4*width*height);
         if (rgbadata==NULL) ERRORMSG();

         for (i=0; i&lt;width*height; i++)
            {
            rgbadata[4*i]=rawdata[3*i];
            rgbadata[4*i+1]=rawdata[3*i+1];
            rgbadata[4*i+2]=rawdata[3*i+2];
            rgbadata[4*i+3]=255;
            }

         rawdata=rgbadata;
         }

      *s3tcbytes=squish::GetStorageRequirements(width,height,mode);
      *s3tcdata=(unsigned char *)malloc(*s3tcbytes);
      if (*s3tcdata==NULL) ERRORMSG();

      squish::CompressImage(rawdata,width,height,*s3tcdata,mode);

      if (isrgbadata==0) free(rawdata);
      }
</pre>

To register the above compression hook we use the following one-liner:<p>

<pre>
   databuf::setautocompress(autocompress,NULL);
</pre>

Finally, the S3TC auto-compression is turned on in the background
thread via datacloud::configure_autocompress(1).<p>

The auto-compression also applies to mip-mapped textures. In order to
automatically generate mip-maps prior to compressing the texture data
we use datacloud::configure_automipmap(1).<p>

Please note that the auto-compression hook is triggered from the
background thread. Therefore it cannot use OpenGL functionality,
because the background thread has no OpenGL context. This is the
reason why we need to utilize a compression library like squish
instead of the OpenGL driver.<p>

<a name="DynamicTerrain"></a>
<h2>(N) Dynamic Terrain</h2>

For certain applications such as utility or telegraph pole placement it is
necessary to modify the terrain at run time. Depending on the extent
of the modified area libMini offers the following options:<p>

<ul>
   <li><b>Large extent:</b> the result of a post-processing operation
   like trenching roads or a mud slide simulation is usually a
   modified data set or a modified part of it. Then the modified part
   can be reloaded at run time via miniload::reload(col,row,...).</li>
   <li><b>Small extent:</b> in order to place telegraph poles, for
   example, the exact position of a pole needs to be matched with the
   level of the terrain at that particular position. This modification
   can be temporary and does not need to have a representation in the
   data set. The same holds for explosion craters and tank
   tracks. Therefore, the elevation values can be modified dynamically
   by using the setheight or setrealheight methods of the libMini
   core. These methods are also available for the ministub and
   minitile class (tile size has to be uniform in the modified area)
   but not for the miniload class. After modifying the terrain using
   the libMini core the terrain needs to be updated with the
   updatemaps method. Otherwise the quadtree operations (culling and
   triangulation) might produce wrong results. The methods of the
   ministub and minitile class take care of updating the terrain
   automatically.</li>

<h2>(O) The libMini Viewer API</h2>

The libMini Viewer API incorporates the previously descibed techniques
into a single package: the rendering core, the vertex buffer and the
asynchronous pager are hidden under the hood of the API. This provides
convenient access to the core capabilities of libMini.<p>

Given that an OpenGL rendering window has been setup with an
appropriate viewing matrix, the task of rendering a tileset with the
libMini Viewer API is as simple as follows:<p>

<pre>
   #include &lt;mini/miniview.h&gt;

   miniview *viewer=new miniview;

   viewer->getearth()->load("url");

   minicoord eye(miniv3d(ex,ey,ez)); // eye point in ECEF
   miniv3d dir(dx,dy,dz); // viewing direction
   miniv3d up(ux,uy,uz); // up vector

   float aspect=width/height; // aspect ratio of viewing window

   viewer->get()->nearp=10.0; // near clipping plane
   viewer->get()->farp=10000.0; // far clipping plane

   viewer->initeyepoint(eye); // prefetch data

   viewer->clear(); // clear frame buffer
   viewer->cache(eye,dir,up,aspect); // fill vertex cache
   viewer->render(); // render vertex cache
</pre>

The coordinates eye/dir/up specify the camera coordinate system in
OpenGL notation. The camera coordinates are interpreted as
geo-referenced ECEF coordinates.<p>

The terrain geometry can be queried by shooting rays at the displayed
scene. The rays are specified by a geo-referenced starting point (in
ECEF coordinates) and a shooting direction:<p>

<pre>
   double dist=viewer->shoot(eye,dir); // shoot ray from eye point
   if (dist==MAXFLOAT) dist=0.0; // nothing hit
   minicoord hitpoint=eye+dist*dir; // calculate hit point in ECEF
</pre>

Displayable tilesets can be generated with libGrid or VTB. For more
details, see the following section.<p>

<a href="#" class="top">Back to top</a>

<a name="MiniViewer"></a>
<h2>(P) The libMini Viewer</h2>

The libMini Viewer is an application for viewing tile sets based on
the <a href="#ViewerAPI">libMini Viewer API</a>. It can load local and
remote tile sets stored on a web server. The supported format is
either PNM which is exported by the built-in libMini resampler or DB
which is output by the gridding core of
<a href="http://libgrid.googlecode.com">libGrid</a> or VTB (virtual
terrain builder of vterrain.org).<p>

The libMini viewer also comes as a QT based version with intuitive
mouse steering and navigation around the earth globe. For the QT based
version the viewer usage guide lines apply in an analog way, except
that it needs to be compiled with QT's qmake. To get the whole
package, checkout the entire libMini svn repository with:<p>

<pre>
   svn co http://libmini.googlecode.com/svn/libmini libmini
</pre>

Then the libMini QTViewer is located in the "qtviewer" directory and
the libMini libraries in the "mini" directory. For more details see the
QTViewer README.<p>

For conceptual information on the modules used by the viewer see
the <a href="http://stereofx.org/download/libMini-Modules.pdf">libMini
Module Overview</a>.<p>

To compile the viewer type "./build.sh viewer" on the command line. It
requires POSIX threads (pthreads),
 <a href="http://www.ijg.org">libjpeg</a>,
 <a href="http://www.libpng.org">libpng</a> /
 <a href="http://www.zlib.net">zlib</a>,
 <a href="http://curl.haxx.se">libcurl</a> and
 <a href="http://libsquish.googlecode.com">squish</a>
to be installed.<p>

On Windows the <a href="http://freeglut.sourceforge.net">freeGLUT
library</a> must be installed, as well. On MacOS X and Linux it comes
with the default OpenGL installation. As a substitute for POSIX
threads it is recommended to
use either
 <a href="http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32">pthreads-win32</a> or
 <a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/svn/osg/OpenThreads">openthreads</a>
from the OpenSceneGraph repository.<p>

The libMini Viewer can also be compiled with CMake. To do so, enable
the option BUILD_MINI_APPS in the CMake configuration (via ccmake or
the Windows CMake GUI). The cmake configuration has the additional
options BUILD_MINI_WITHOUT_SQUISH, BUILD_MINI_WITH_GREYC and
BUILD_MINI_WITH_OPENTHREADS to compile without squish, with
CIMG/GREYCstoration or with openthreads, respectively.<p>

If some of the required or optional dependencies cannot be found,
because they have not been installed at a standard location like
/usr/local, you can specify each directory separately or override the
standard installation directory with the variable
LIBMINI_THIRDPARTY_DIR in the CMake configuration.<p>

Once you managed to install the dependencies and compile the libMini
Viewer, see the following examples how to use it from the command
line:<p>

<pre>
   local usage:
      viewer &lt;local.base.path&gt; &lt;tileset.path&gt; &lt;elevation.subpath&gt; imagery.subpath { &lt;options&gt; }

   local example (for loading the data of the Hawaii Demo):
      viewer ~user/.../Hawaii/ data/HawaiiTileset/ elev imag

   remote usage:
      viewer "&lt;http-address&gt;" &lt;tileset.path&gt; &lt;elevation.subpath&gt; &lt;imagery.subpath&gt; { &lt;options&gt; }

   remote example:
      viewer "http://server.inter.net/.../" tileset/ elevation imagery
</pre>

If the data is resampled with VTB make sure that a metric coordinate
system like UTM is chosen. Also make sure that the two ini files for
the elevation and the imagery are made available in the tile set path,
because the viewer automatically retrieves necessary information from
the ini files. The libMini Viewer tries to guess their names by adding
the .ini suffix to the respective subpath. The default setting for the
vtp subpaths is "elev" and "imag". If you stick to that naming
convention, when generating the elevation and imagery tile sets with
vtp, you can start the libMini Viewer with just one argument:<p>

<pre>
   short usage:
      viewer &lt;url/path&gt;
</pre>

This is equivalent to the multi-argument usage of "viewer url/ path/
elev imag", so that the directory layout has to be as follows:<p>

<pre>
   url/
       path/
            elev/
                 tile.0-0.db
                 ...
            elev.ini
            imag/
                 tile.0-0.db
                 ...
            imag.ini
</pre>

For multiple tilesets we use the following command line:<p>

<pre>
   multi usage:
      viewer -m { &lt;url/path&gt; [ &lt;detailtex.db&gt; ] }
</pre>

There is no limit on the maximum number of displayable tilesets. All
tilesets will be shown at their corresponding geo-referenced place on
earth. But keep in mind that the performance is mainly limited by the
number of visible tiles, so that the total number of visible tilesets
and tiles should be kept as low as possible.<p>

As an option, the Mini Viewer supports one geo-referenced detail
texture per tileset. Currently, the only supported file format for the
detail textures is libMini's internal DB format.<p>

The initial viewing settings favor rendering performance over
quality. To increase the visualization quality, you can increase the
following quality parameters interactively: the far clipping distance
(farp), the triangle mesh resolution (res) and the texture detail
level (range). To check these parameters press the h key. This turns
on the head up display (HUD) which displays information about the
available keyboard controls.<p>

Optionally, you can run the libMini Viewer in anaglyph stereo mode by
appending "-s -a" to the command line. You need to put on red/cyan
glasses to get the stereo effect. To start the viewer in full-screen
mode use the -f option. For full usage information on all available
command line options start the viewer without arguments.<p>

On a side note, the libMini Viewer can be configured to
use <a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/svn/osg/OpenThreads">OpenThreads</a>
instead of pthreads by typing "./build.sh viewer useopenth". On
Windows, the libMini Viewer uses OpenThreads by default but can be
configured to use a pthread implementation such
as <a href="http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32">pthreads-win32</a>.<p>

There is also the option to disable squish support ("./build.sh viewer
nosquish") which provides S3TC compression on the fly.

Another option is to enable
<a href="http://cimg.sourceforge.net">CImg/GREYCstoration</a> support
("./build.sh viewer usegreyc") to denoise uncompressed imagery on the
fly.<p>

<a href="#" class="top">Back to top</a>

<a name="ErrorHandling"></a>
<h2>(Q) Error Handling</h2>

Normally, libMini will run silently doing just what it is ought to do.
However, if it encounters insufficient resources (either insufficient
memory or disk space) it will print an error on the console and
quit. For that purpose it uses the macro ERRORMSG().<p>

If it is required to catch these errors, a signal handler can be
provided via setminierrorhandler() as defined in minibase.h to safely
handle the exceptions (e.g. by closing or restarting the terrain
renderer without shutting down the main application).<p>

<a href="#" class="top">Back to top</a>

<a name="Linkage"></a>
<h2>(R) Linkage with CMake</h2>

If you want to link your own project with libMini using CMake, copy
the CMakeModule/FindMINI.cmake module into your project and let CMake
find the libMini package and the required OpenGL installation in the
cmake file "CMakeLists.txt":<p>

<pre>
   SET(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/CMakeModules;${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH}")

   FIND_PACKAGE(OpenGL)

   FIND_PACKAGE(MINI)
   INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${MINI_INCLUDE_DIR})

   IF (MINI_FOUND)
      MESSAGE(STATUS found libMini headers: ${MINI_INCLUDE_DIR})
      MESSAGE(STATUS found libMini libs: ${MINI_LIBRARIES})
   ENDIF (MINI_FOUND)
   IF (MINISFX_FOUND)
      MESSAGE(STATUS found libMiniSFX libs: ${MINISFX_LIBRARIES})
   ENDIF (MINISFX_FOUND)
</pre>

Then add libMini for basic libMini support or libMiniSFX for
additional viewer support and the OpenGL libraries as additional link
target for your application, e.g. "myapp":<p>

<pre>
   TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(myapp ${MINI_LIBRARIES} ${OPENGL_LIBRARIES})
</pre>

For an example, see the "example.cmake" folder, which contains an
example libMini CMake project with the dependencies OpenGL and
GLUT. To compile it, type the following command line in the Unix
terminal:<p>

<pre>
   cmake . && make
</pre>

<h1>Appendix Of Optional Modules</h1>

<a name="Minisky"></a>
<h2>Appendix (1) Minisky</h2>

This class implements a sky dome which is textured by a 2D texture
parametrized with polar coordinates. For an example please see the
libMini Viewer (Section <a href="#MiniViewer">(P)</a>).<p>

<a href="#" class="top">Back to top</a>

<a name="Minitext"></a>
<h2>Appendix (2) Minitext</h2>

This module implements a 3D OpenGL text renderer which uses a
minimalistic vector representation of the ASCII character set. All
characters used by the C programming language are supported. The
minitext is mainly intended for prototyping purposes where
fully-fledged anti-aliased text would be sort of an overkill. For
example, it is used in the libMini Viewer (see
Section <a href="#MiniViewer">(P)</a>) to render the HUD.<p>

<a href="#" class="top">Back to top</a>

<a name="Minitree"></a>
<h2>Appendix (3) Vegetation Rendering</h2>

The Mini Library also supports vegetation rendering. The height of the
vegetation layer is defined by an additional height field. Now for all
rendered triangles a prism is generated that stacks on top of each
triangle and fits in between the terrain and the upper boundary of the
vegetation layer. This is a volumetric description of the
vegetation. The so-defined vegetation volume is used to place plants
of varying height. As a result, wood, shrub and meadow is generated in
a procedural way from the additional input height field.<p>

A more detailed description is given in
the <a href="http://stereofx.org/papers/VEGETATION.PDF">paper</a>. The
reader is also encouraged to try the Fraenkische Demo which applies
the described approach.<p>

<a href="#" class="top">Back to top</a>

<a name="Minibrick"></a>
<h2>Appendix (4) Volume Rendering With The Minibrick</h2>

The minibrick class implements volume rendering of regular
time-dependent data by displaying multiple shaded semi-transparent iso
surfaces. The complexity of the scene is controlled by using a
volumetric C-LOD approach and an octree for the efficient culling of
sub-volumes that do not contain any iso surface.<p>

For conceptual information on the volume rendering approach see
the <a href="http://stereofx.org/download/libMini-VolRen.pdf">libMini
Volume Rendering Overview</a>.<p>

A volume is given by a tile set with r rows and c columns that extend
in the horizontal plane and form what is called a minibrick. The
preferable tile size is 2^n+1 (n may vary to yield varying size along
the tile edges). The tile data needs to be provided in a databuf
object container which is passed to the library using a callback
mechanism. The load callback is triggered for each visible tile. In
the callback the tile to be loaded is identified by its row and
column. The availability of each tile is checked with the isavailable
callback. Currently only two methods are provided that load a PVM (see
Section <a href="#PVMdoc">Appendix (6B)</a>) or a MOE volume and store
the data in the databuf object. So usually the application layer will
implement its own methods for setting up the databuf objects being
passed in the load callback. Use the minibrick.setloader method to
register your own callbacks with the library. The tiles do not need to
be axis-aligned, but must have a rectangular basis. Therefore, please
ensure that the corner coordinates of each databuf object are set to
suitable values. Otherwise seams will be visible.<p>

The appearance of a minibrick volume is determined by a so called
spectrum of iso surfaces. Each single iso surface of the spectrum is
defined by using the minibrick.addiso(iso,R,G,B,A) method which
specifies the iso value and the corresponding RGB color and opacity of
each iso surface.<p>

Three different rendering methods can be configured. These methods
implement either 2-, 3- or 4-pass rendering. The 2-pass method renders
the opaque triangles in the first pass and the semi-transparent
triangles in the second pass. This is the fastest available method,
but artifacts may arise because the semi-transparent geometry is only
sorted by iso surface number and not by depth order. In order to
suppress these artifacts, the 3-pass method accumulates the opacity in
the second pass and sums up the emission in the third pass. The 4-pass
method improves image quality even further by selectively neglecting
the emissions behind the first encountered back-face. The 3-pass
method is a good compromise between speed and visual quality, thus it
is enabled by default.<p>

It is possible to render an arbitrary number a bricks
simultaneously. The bricks could even intersect each other. For this
to work, the render passes of each single brick have to be interleaved
in the following way:<p>

<pre>
   // declare n bricks
   minibrick bricks[n];

   // render the bricks in an interleaved fashion
   for (int i=MINIBRICK_FIRST_RENDER_PHASE; i<=MINIBRICK_LAST_RENDER_PHASE; i++)
      for (int j=0; i&lt;n; j++)
         brick[j].render(ex,ey,ez,rad,farp,fovy,aspect,time,i);
</pre>

Additionally, each brick can have up to six clipping planes that are
set via minibrick::setclip. The clip planes are defined by a number,
an origin and a normal vector.<p>

The level of detail of the visualization is determined by the radius
parameter rad. Within this radius around the view point the maximum
level of detail is enabled. Outside the radius the resolution
gradually decreases. The library interpolates smoothly between the
level of details so that the popping effect is suppressed efficiently.
Since this involves a good deal of floating point arithmetic the user
should use the multi-threading support of the library to decouple the
update of the iso surface geometry from rendering. This means that one
thread continuously updates the geometry (if the view point has
changed) while the other thread is busy rendering the latest cached
geometry. This approach has the advantage that the frame rate only
depends on the speed of the graphics hardware and is not limited by
the update time that is needed to interpolate and extract the iso
surfaces.  Multi-threading is enabled by passing appropriate callbacks
to the minibrick::setthread method as illustrated in the Hawaii Demo
(see Section <a href="#Performance">(I)</a>).<p>

In order to get a better understanding of the capabilities of the
minibrick module please check out the Hawaii Demo. Start it with the
-b option, press 'm' to go to Makai Pier in Waimanalo at the east side
of Oahu and look at the scene with a bird's eye view. Then you see a
time-dependent visualization of the evolution of a thunder storm with
one opaque and two semi-transparent iso-surfaces.<p>

<a name="Formats"></a>
<h1>Appendix Of File Formats</h1>

<a name="PNMdoc"></a>
<h2>Appendix (A) PNM Image Format Description</h2>

The Mini Library supports the PNM image format (PNM = Portable
aNy-Map) to read tile sets from disk. Color images have the file
extension .ppm (Portable Picture Map = PPM), gray-scale images have
the extension .pgm (Portable Gray-scale Map = PGM). The format
consists of an ASCII header that defines type, size and bit depth in
an easily readable way
(see <a
href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net">netpbm.sourceforge.net</a>). The
raw image data follows directly after the header. In contrast to the
original netpbm library libMini does not optionally support ASCII
image data and it also does not support image types other than color
and gray-scale. With these restrictions a plain PNM image is defined
as follows:<p>

<pre>
   &lt;TYPE&gt;\n
   &lt;WIDTH&gt; &lt;HEIGHT&gt;\n
   &lt;MAXVAL&gt;\n
   ...DATA...
</pre>

with<p>

<pre>
   &lt;TYPE&gt;   = P5 | P6 | P8 ::: P5 = PGM, P6 = PPM, P8 = RGBA
   &lt;WIDTH&gt;  = %d           ::: width of texture/heightmap
   &lt;HEIGHT&gt; = %d           ::: height of texture/heightmap
   &lt;MAXVAL&gt; = %d           ::: maximum value
</pre>

For 8 bit images MAXVAL is 255, for 16 bit images MAXVAL is either
32767 or 65535. In the 16 bit case libMini always assumes the data to
be signed 16 bit (stored in MSB format). The header may additionally
contain comments starting with a '#' in each line.<p>

The plain PNM format does not contain georeferencing information. For
this purpose, libMini is using a comment section after the TYPE
identifier to include the missing information (thanks to Kyle
Dickerson for the compilation):<p>

The libMini core only supports the BOX georeferencing type meaning
that the contained data is enclosed exactly within the bounding box
spanned by the four corner points. The built-in resampler also
distinguishes between the two following types: DEM means that the
contained data is a height field and that the corner coordinates
define the exact position of the four corner vertices (corner-centric
grid representation). TEX means that the contained data is a texture
map and that the corner coordinates define the position of the
midpoint of the four corner pixels (cell-centric grid
representation). The missing value field is used by DEM formats to
identify cells with unknown or unspecified elevation. A typical value
is -9999. The no-data value for imagery assumed by the built-in
resampler is absolute black (0,0,0). This is a safe assumption since
real world imagery hardly contains true black. If this is not the
case, the black pixels can be easily substituted with an RGB value of
(0,0,1), which is visually equal to black.<p>

<h2>Appendix (B) PVM Volume Format Description</h2>

Similar to the PNM image format, the PVM volume format defines
volumetric data in an easily readable fashion:<p>

<pre>

   &lt;HEIGHT&gt;     = %d  ::: height of volume
   &lt;COMPONENTS&gt; = %d  ::: number of components
</pre>

For 8 bit data the number of components is 1, for 16 bit data 2 and
for RGB movies it is 3. The voxel spacing is assumed to be uniform.<p>

A PVM example header for a 256x256x256 volume with 1 byte per voxel:<p>

<pre>
   PVM
   256 256 256

If the magic identifier is PVM2 or PVM3, this indicates newer
versions of the format, which include the voxel spacing in the header:<p>

<pre>
   &lt;MAGIC&gt;\n
   &lt;WIDTH&gt; &lt;HEIGHT&gt; &lt;DEPTH&gt;\n
   &lt;VOXEL_WIDTH&gt; &lt;VOXEL_HEIGHT&gt; &lt;VOXEL_DEPTH&gt;\n

PVM files often come in a DDS compressed data format. In that case the
data startes with the prefix "DDS v3d". You can uncompress those files
with the dds tool.<p>

<a name="DBdoc"></a>
<h2>Appendix (C) DB Data Format Description</h2>

While the built-in image format for tile sets is PNM, it is clear that
libMini needs to support other file formats as well. This is achieved
by registering a callback with libMini which handles loading the
requested data in a proprietary format. The registered function copies
the required information into a generic data buffer object which is
returned to the Mini Library. In this way the data retrieval from the
terrain data base can be handled completely in the application and is
decoupled entirely from libMini. The data buffer is realized by the
databuf class. It can contain 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D data. The class has
methods to load and save its content in its native DB format but it is
able to load from PNM files, too. The file extension of the native
format is .db. Similar to PNM, the header is human readable consisting
of the following fields:<p>

</pre>

The data chunk is appended as raw data to the above description.<p>

Data type 1 and 2 is stored in MSB format. After loading the data into
main memory it is automatically converted into the native MSB or LSB
format of the CPU. The description must end with a NUL character. <p>

Previous versions of the DB format with magic identifier 13091 or less
did not include the fields crs, zone, datum, nodata, and LLWGS84.<p>

A value other than zero for extformat indicates that the data chunk is
stored in an external format. When calling databuf::loaddata on such
an object it automatically tries to trigger an external conversion
hook to transform the input data into the corresponding raw
format. The hook can be set via databuf::setconversion. As an example,
extformat=1 in the header of a DB file means that the appended data
chunk is encoded as a JPEG image. For more information on this issue,
please have a look at the libMini Viewer (as described in
Section <a href="#MiniViewer">(P)</a>) which demonstrates how to use
the conversion hook mechanism in order to decode JPEG images. If the
extfmt parameter of databuf::savedata is set, the conversion hook is
also triggered to convert the raw data into the external format.<p>

A value other than zero for implformat indicates that the data chunk
is stored in an implicit format, in which the data is interpreted as
LUNA program. For example, the following db file produces a checkboard
pattern in a procedural way:<p>
